# 👋 Hey, I’m Abhishek Mukherjee  
### 🚀 Aerodynamics • Flight Mechanics • CFD • Python • Simulation Dev

I’m a 23-year-old M.Tech student at **IIST**, deep-diving into **Aerodynamics** and **Flight Mechanics**, and building tools that make airflow and aircraft motion *make sense*.  
I majorly work on **CFD code development**, **simulation pipelines**, and physics-heavy tooling in **Python**.

I vibe with high-impact engineering, clean code, and solving problems that actually *matter*.  
Right now, I’m pushing toward roles in **aerospace simulation**, **aero design**, and **propulsion analysis**, especially at next-gen companies and the aero startups pushing the frontier.

## ✈️ What I Work On
- 🌀 **CFD toolchains** — solver dev, mesh handling, automation  
- 🧮 **Numerical methods & simulation modeling**  
- 📊 **Data visualization & analysis**  
- 🔧 Optimizing code for accuracy + speed (because slow solvers are a crime)

## 🔥 Featured Skills
**Languages:** Python, C++, MATLAB  
**Domains:** CFD, Aerodynamics, Flight Mechanics, Propulsion  
**Tools:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, OpenFOAM (learning), Git, Linux  
**Interests:** High-performance computing, reduced-order models, aero-thermal systems

## 🛠️ Current Thesis Work
I’m developing CFD simulation modules for analyzing solver performance in compressible flow simulations with shock capturing. Scraping for better accuracy and stable schemes for low-dissipative simulations. Has been a wild ride of coding, testing, and validating against benchmark cases!

## 💡 Philosophy
Keep it simple. Keep it elegant.  
If the math is right and the code is clean, everything else falls into place.
